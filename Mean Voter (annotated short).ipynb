    "*This notebook is part of a [three-part series](https://lawyerist.com/124089/hello-world-attorneys-learn-code/) on learning to code. If you haven't already, start by reading the accompanying [blog posts](https://lawyerist.com/?p=127093). This notebook is meant to supplement post number three--[Build a Bot; Banish FOMO](https://lawyerist.com/?p=127093).*\n",

    "## Install libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, you may need to install some dependencies. On the command line, run the following to install/update gspread, oauth2client, PyOpenSSL, and python-twitter.\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install gspread\n",
    "pip install --upgrade oauth2client\n",
    "pip install PyOpenSSL\n",
    "pip install python-twitter\n",
    "```\n",
    "Library installs are one and done. So after doing this once, you should be all set. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Import modules and set variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're getting into the bot's code. This is what will run every time your bot is called. To make sure it behaves as expected, replace the placeholder values found below in the `document_key`, `credentials`, `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_token_key`, and `access_token_secret` variables with relevant values (e.g., your access credentials). Once you've done that, run the code in the following cell. If everything works, you shouldn't see any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of this code should look familiar as you set up Google credentials in the last homework assignment. In fact, when filling in your Google credentials, you should be using the .json file that you used last time. You will, however, need to create a new Google Sheet (same instructions as [last time](https://lawyerist.com/126074/online-forms-meet-local-document-automation-cut-and-paste-coding/)). You **MUST** add a first row with headings. If you don't, the below code won't work. In this example, just make four columns filled with zeros. Also, delete rows 2-999. This is because the code below appends values to the end of your sheet. So if you fail to remove rows 2-999, values will be appended to row 1000. Additionally, it looks at the last row of the sheet for your old values. So if you fail to delete 2-999, instead of seeing your row of zeros, it will look at the blank row 999.\n",

    "As for a Twitter account and Twitter credentials, follow the instruction in [this post](https://lawyerist.com/?p=127093). \n",
